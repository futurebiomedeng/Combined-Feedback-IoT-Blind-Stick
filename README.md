# Combined-Feedback-IoT-Blind-Stick

This project presents an innovative smart walking stick designed to enhance mobility and safety for visually impaired users. The device is not only a conventional mobility aid, but an intelligent assistive system equipped with modern sensing and feedback technologies to support independent navigation in daily activities.

The smart walking stick features four ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection, enabling the system to identify objects in front of the user and help prevent collisions. Detected obstacles are communicated through an interactive multimodal feedback system, including audio signals, vibration feedback, and controlled mechanical movement, enabling users to perceive their surroundings intuitively without relying on external assistance.

To improve user safety, the system is equipped with a GPS module for location tracking, which can be useful in emergency situations. Additionally, a panic button feature is implemented to provide extra security. When activated, the device triggers an audible alarm and sends the user’s location to a pre-registered contact via SMS. This feature is intended to support rapid assistance when the user is in unfamiliar or unsafe environments
